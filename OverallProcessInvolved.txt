Overview of the project
Data Analysis
Show the difference between normal and fraud(imbalance datasets)
why we need to do sub process(effects of imbalance data)
techniques to solve imbalance dataset
train using different techniques 
see the result
since confusion matrix is not good for these imbalance data
we measure accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).
